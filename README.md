The target is to evaluate the performance of the deep learning algorithm to predict per Kellgren and Lawrence grades. The Kellgren and Lawrence classification system: grade 0 (normal): definite absence of x-ray changes of osteoarthritis grade 1 (doubtful): doubtful joint space narrowing and possible osteophytic lipping grade 2 (mid): definite osteophytes and possible joint space narrowing grade 3 (moderate): moderate multiple osteophytes, definite narrowing of joint space and some sclerosis and possible deformity of bone ends grade 4 (severe): large osteophytes, marked narrowing of joint space, severe sclerosis and definite deformity of the bone end.
